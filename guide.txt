Technical Interview Project Brief
AI-Powered Lead Generation & Outreach Automation
Estimated Time: 16 hours
Submission Deadline: Feb 13, 2026
Project Overview
Build a script/application that automates the lead generation and outreach process by:
Using AI to discover companies matching specified criteria within a given region
Retrieving contact information via Hunter.io
Creating leads in Monday.com
Sending automated introduction emails
This project evaluates your ability to integrate multiple APIs, work with AI services, handle data flows, and build reliable automation workflows.
Functional Requirements
1. Company Discovery (AI-Powered Search)
Input Parameters:
company_type - Industry or business type (e.g., "solar energy installers", "manufacturing companies", "SaaS startups")
region - Geographic area (e.g., "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "Greater Toronto Area", "British Columbia")
count - Number of companies to find (default: 10, max: 50)
Expected Behavior:
Use an AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, or similar) to search for and identify real companies matching the criteria
Return structured data including: company name, website, brief description, and any available contact information
Handle edge cases where limited results are available
AI Provider: Candidate's choice (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Perplexity, or other). Justify your selection.
2. Contact Enrichment (Hunter.io Integration)
Required Functionality:
For each discovered company, use Hunter.io's API to:
Find email addresses associated with the company domain
Identify decision-makers (prioritize: CEO, Founder, Owner, Director, Manager)
Retrieve name, position, and email confidence score
Implement rate limiting to respect API constraints
Handle cases where no contacts are found gracefully
Hunter.io API: Use their free tier (25 requests/month for testing). Document how the solution would scale with a paid plan.
3. CRM Integration (Monday.com)
Required Functionality:
Create a new item in a specified Monday.com board for each qualified lead
Populate the following fields (create columns as needed):
Company Name
Website/Domain
Contact Name
Contact Email
Contact Position
Company Description
Region
Lead Source (mark as "AI Discovery")
Status (default: "New Lead")
Date Added
Prevent duplicate entries (check if company/email already exists)
4. Email Outreach (Introduction Email)
Required Functionality:
Trigger an introduction email to the discovered contact
Email should be:
Personalized with contact name and company name
Professional and concise
Customizable via template (support placeholder variables)
Implementation options (choose one):
Direct SMTP integration
SendGrid/Mailgun API
Monday.com email integration
Other email service API
Log email sent status back to Monday.com record
Email Template Example:
Subject: Quick Introduction - [Your Company] + {{company_name}}

Hi {{contact_name}},

I came across {{company_name}} while researching {{company_type}} companies in {{region}} and wanted to reach out.

[Customizable body paragraph]

Would you be open to a brief conversation?

Best regards,
[Sender Name]

Technical Requirements
Code Quality
Clean, readable, well-documented code
Proper error handling throughout
Logging for debugging and monitoring
Configuration management (no hardcoded API keys)
Architecture
Modular design with clear separation of concerns
Each integration (AI, Hunter, Monday, Email) should be its own module/service
Easy to extend or swap out individual components
Configuration
Provide a configuration file or environment variables for:
API keys (all services)
Monday.com board ID and column mappings
Email template and sender information
Default search parameters
Documentation
Include a README with:
Setup instructions
Environment variable requirements
How to run the script
Example usage
Known limitations
Ideas for future improvements
Deliverables
Source Code - Complete, runnable codebase (GitHub repository preferred)
README.md - Comprehensive documentation
Configuration Template - .env.example or similar
Demo Video (optional but recommended) - 5-10 minute walkthrough showing:
Running the script with sample inputs
Results appearing in Monday.com
Email being triggered
Brief Write-up (1-2 pages) covering:
Technical decisions and trade-offs
Challenges encountered and solutions
How you would improve/scale this solution
Time breakdown of how you spent the 16 hours

Batch Processing - Process multiple company types/regions in one run
Deduplication - Smart matching to avoid re-contacting existing leads
CLI Interface - User-friendly command-line interface with argument parsing
Progress Reporting - Real-time progress updates during execution
Export Options - CSV/JSON export of discovered leads
AI-Generated Emails - Use AI to personalize email content per lead
Scheduling - Built-in scheduler for recurring searches
Dashboard/UI - Simple web interface to configure and run searches

Submission Instructions
Push your code to a GitHub repository (public or private with access granted)
Include all deliverables in the repository
Email the repository link to [Insert Email] by [Insert Deadline]
Include any credentials needed to test (use test/sandbox accounts where possible)
Questions?
If you have questions or need clarification on any requirements, please reach out to [Insert Contact] at [Insert Email]. We're happy to provide guidance while still allowing you to demonstrate independent problem-solving.
Notes
Focus on building a working solution first, then refine
It's acceptable to use AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) - just be prepared to explain your code
Free tiers of APIs are sufficient for demonstrating functionality
If you run into API limitations, document what you would do differently with full access
We value thoughtful trade-offs over perfect implementations
Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.
